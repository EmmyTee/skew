skew
====

**Skew** is a package for identifying and enumerating cloud resources.
The name is a homonym for SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).  Skew uses the
basic structure of
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html](Amazon
Resource Names) (ARNs) to assign a unique identifier to every cloud
resource.  This identifier, and regular expressions based on the
pattern, can then be used to identify and enumerate a resource or set
of resources.
